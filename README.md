# Brew box 
A chain coffee shop in Rwanda, part of the restaurant industry. The business scenario will involve the management department. This business experienced low profits during the COVID-19 period, attributing it to the quarantine. However, even after the lockdown was lifted, profits didnâ€™t bounce back. Consequently, management had to determine how employee performance affected overall efficiency and which locations were profitable. This is how they solved that problem.
